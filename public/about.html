<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> Hi, I’m Mikey! <br><br>
   I’m a first-year BCA student exploring the world of web development. While I’m still figuring out my path, I’m excited to learn and gain new skills along the way 
   and to gain hands-on experience and develop my skills further. <br><br>

  I also have a passion for drawing, which allows me to express my creativity. <br><br>
  
  I’m looking forward to discovering opportunities that will help me grow both personally and professionally!</p>
